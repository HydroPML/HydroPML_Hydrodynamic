# HydroPML_Hydrodynamic
Hydrodynamic models are mathematical models that attempt to replicate fluid motion and typically require solving computationally. These models simulate water movement by solving equations formulated by applying laws of physics. Hydrodynamic models can realize the simulation of hydrological process in seconds, hours to days time scale.
